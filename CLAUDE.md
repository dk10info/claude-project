This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a web project hosted in an XAMPP environment (located at `/mnt/c/xampp/htdocs/claude-project`).

## Tech Stack

- **Environment**: XAMPP (Apache, MySQL, PHP, Perl)
- **Location**: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) mounted from Windows XAMPP installation

## Development Environment

The project is accessed through WSL2 but is hosted on a Windows XAMPP installation, as evidenced by the `/mnt/c/xampp/htdocs/` path.

## Project Structure

Currently minimal - only contains:
- README.md
- CLAUDE.md (this file)

## Notes

This appears to be a newly initialized project with minimal structure. As the project grows, this file should be updated with:
- Specific commands for running/testing the application
- Database connection details (without credentials)
- API endpoints and routing patterns
- Key architectural decisions
